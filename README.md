# TortoiseFrame Class:
Represents the graphical interface for the game.
Uses Tkinter for creating the game window and rendering the elements.
Initializes the game world, sets up the canvas, and loads images for different elements like walls, lettuce, ponds, and the tortoise.
# TortoiseWorld Class:
Represents the actual game world and logic.
Manages the movement of the tortoise and updates the game state accordingly.
The tortoise can move in four directions: north, east, south, and west.
The game world is a grid with different types of cells: ground, walls, stones, lettuce, and ponds.
The tortoise's movement is determined by its "brain," represented by the tortoise_brain parameter. This brain is responsible for making decisions based on sensory input.
# step_tortoise Method (in TortoiseWorld):
Handles the tortoise's movement and interactions with the environment.
Moves the tortoise based on the result of its "thinking" process (handled by the brain).
Updates the tortoise's position, drink level, and health based on the environment.
Checks for win or loss conditions and updates the game state accordingly.
# create_worldmap Method (in TortoiseWorld):
Generates a random game world map with walls, stones, lettuce, and ponds.
Ensures that stones are not placed in a way that creates inaccessible areas.
Places lettuce and ponds randomly on the map.
# Sensor Class:
Represents the sensory input for the tortoise.
Provides information about the environment in front of and around the tortoise, including the presence of walls, lettuce, and water.
Contains the tortoise's current position, direction, and drink level.
# runWithGraphics and runWithoutGraphics Methods (in TortoiseFrame):
# runWithGraphics initializes the Tkinter main loop for running the game with graphical representation.
runWithoutGraphics runs the game without graphics, essentially calling the step method repeatedly.
